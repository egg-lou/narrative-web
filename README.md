## Project Description
This repository contains a website I created for our Civic Welfare Training Service (CWTS) Immersion. It serves as a platform to compile all narrative reports and memories for our block section in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 1 - 4. This project is a personal endeavor that I want to share with the entire class.

The website provides a centralized location for accessing and reviewing the narrative reports and memories related to the CWTS Immersion.
